                    <summary>Is Mental Illness Treatable??</summary>
                    <p class="text">Yes, mental illness is treatable. In many cases, the symptoms of a mental illness improve with psychotherapy, medication or a combination of both. Alternative treatments, such as support groups and self-help materials, can also be
                        used in conjunction with therapy and medication. Treatment impacts people differently and should always be individualized and discussed with a mental health practitioner.</p>

            <div class="faqs">
                <details>
                    <summary>Myth 1: People are born with a mental illness.</summary>
                    <p class="text">Fact: A vulnerability to some mental illnesses, such as bipolar mood disorder, can run in families. But other people develop mental illness with no family history. Many factors contribute to the onset of a mental illness. These may
                        include stress, bereavement, relationship breakdown, unemployment, social isolation, a major physical illness, physical and sexual abuse, or disability. Our understanding of the causes of mental illness is growing.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary>Myth 2: Mental illness is caused by a personal weakness.</summary>
                    <p class="text">Fact: A mental illness is not a character flaw. It is caused by a complex interplay of genetic, biological, social and environmental factors. Seeking and accepting help is a sign of resilience and strength.
                    </p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Myth 3: People with a mental illness are dangerous.</summary>
                    <p class="text">Fact: This false perception underlies some of the most damaging stereotypes for people with mental illness. People with a mental illness are seldom dangerous. Even people with the most severe mental illness, whose symptoms may cause
                        them to act in bizarre or unusual ways, are rarely dangerous.

                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Myth 4: Mental illness is a form of intellectual disability or brain damage.</summary>
                    <p class="text">Fact: They are illnesses just like any other, such as heart disease, diabetes, and asthma. Yet the traditions of sympathy, support, and flowers given to people with physical illnesses are often denied to those with a mental illness.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>
                        Myth 5: People with a mental illness can ‘pull themselves out of it’.</summary>
                    <p class="text">Fact: A mental illness is not caused by personal weakness and is not ‘cured’ by personal strength.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Myth 6: People with a mental illness should be isolated from the community.</summary>
                    <p class="text">Fact: Most people with a mental illness recover quickly and do not need hospital care. Others may have short admissions to hospital for treatment. Only a very small number of people with mental illness (less than 1 in 1000) need hospital
                        care. Improvements in treatment over recent decades mean that most people live in their communities, and there is no need for the confinement and isolation that was commonly used in the past.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Myth 7: Mental illness is incurable and lifelong.</summary>
                    <p class="text">Fact: With the right kind of help, treated appropriately and early, most people recover fully and have no further episodes of illness. For others, mental illness may recur throughout their lives and require ongoing treatment. This
                        is the same as many physical illnesses, such as diabetes and heart disease. Like these other long-term health conditions, mental illness can be managed so that individuals live life to the fullest.</p>
